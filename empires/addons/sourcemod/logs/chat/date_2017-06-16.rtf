[Jun 16 |00:41:13| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: well it's an infantry map\par
[Jun 16 |00:41:24| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: can't expect people to teamplay on infantry maps\par
[Jun 16 |00:41:53| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: why?\par
[Jun 16 |00:42:35| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because noobs, because whenever skilled people are on you don't play infantry maps anymore\par
[Jun 16 |00:42:44| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because teamplay is apparently a mysterious thing\par
[Jun 16 |00:42:49| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: that people can't seem to figure out\par
[Jun 16 |00:43:36| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: noobs and lack of teamplay are universal, but i can't agree with the "skilled people -> no infantry maps" thing\par
[Jun 16 |00:43:52| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: it's more that when skilled people are on, there's enough people to play a non-infantry map\par
[Jun 16 |00:44:08| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: so people resume playing classic empires\par
[Jun 16 |00:44:26| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: that's what I implied\par
[Jun 16 |00:44:37| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: also it really doesn't help that the way a lot of standard infantry maps are made\par
[Jun 16 |00:44:51| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: skilled players can turn them into a grind\par
[Jun 16 |00:45:04| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: that takes untold amounts of time and lacks a resolution\par
[Jun 16 |00:45:11| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: WW1 was boring as shit for the most part\par
[Jun 16 |00:45:19| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I may just turn all infantry maps into bleeders\par
[Jun 16 |00:45:21| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: trenches are cool only when assaulting them\par

[Jun 16 |00:45:59| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: dickstreets is shit\par
[Jun 16 |00:46:06| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: the second flag for both BE and NF is constructed in a way that almost prohibits attacking\par
[Jun 16 |00:46:42| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: i mean, just calling something shit is not really enough to pinpoint the reason behind the problems\par
[Jun 16 |00:46:46| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: well it could just be removed from official maps to be honest\par
