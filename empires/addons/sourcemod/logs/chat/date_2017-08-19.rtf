[Aug 19 |13:55:50| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: most of the games your mmr is hiding but for empires is all right\par
[Aug 19 |13:56:03| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: the source is available\par
[Aug 19 |13:56:20| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: so really there is no point hiding it\par
[Aug 19 |13:56:34| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: everyone can see how its calculated\par
[Aug 19 |13:58:04| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: there is a problem in your ranked game if some one has a high mmr 2-3 good players join the other team for empires every player\par
[Aug 19 |13:58:14| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: who can play the game counts more\par
[Aug 19 |13:58:21| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: than skill\par
[Aug 19 |13:59:22| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: is seems like is uneven because 2-3 good players a always better than 1 high mmr\par
[Aug 19 |13:59:25| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: well yea, but the average mmr is growing. New players start at 1000 which is way below average, and bad players lose mmr\par
[Aug 19 |13:59:52| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: i dont saw any player below 1000\par

[Aug 19 |14:00:14| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: holy\par
[Aug 19 |14:00:18| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: top rank wont show it\par
[Aug 19 |14:00:28| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: it stops once it gets to 1000\par
[Aug 19 |14:01:18| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: i always got some points even if i am losing like repair revive just being a teamplayer is enough how do you lose points any\par
[Aug 19 |14:01:21| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: way ?\par
[Aug 19 |14:01:48| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: the only way to gain mmr is to win, if you lose you lose mmr\par
[Aug 19 |14:01:57| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: those are the only factors\par
[Aug 19 |14:02:20| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: i feel like i am losing all the time and still rank 6\par
[Aug 19 |14:02:20| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: based on if your team is favoured or not depends how much you get\par
[Aug 19 |14:02:36| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: those ranks are only for ranked games\par
[Aug 19 |14:02:43| 2017]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: ohh\par
[Aug 19 |14:02:48| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: if you type !rank it explains this isnt a ranked game\par

[Aug 19 |14:04:04| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: but you are placed based on your hidden mmr\par
[Aug 19 |14:04:14| 2017]  Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: which works for all games\par

[Aug 19 |14:05:44| 2017] \cf2 Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: and the auto-assigns after draft will always balaced the average mmr of both teams\par

[Aug 19 |14:06:42| 2017] \cf2 Mikleo (STEAM_0:1:188129659)\cf0: maybe, but at max its 4 players and then the other team get 4 of the remaining best players\par
